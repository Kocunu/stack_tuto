# Understanding How Stacks Work

## Introduction

A stack is a fundamental data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It operates much like a stack of plates where the last plate placed on the stack is the first one to be removed. Understanding how a stack works involves two primary operations: `push` and `pop`.

## Push Operation

The `push` operation adds an element to the top of the stack. As new elements are added, they are placed on top of the existing elements. The stack grows in the upward direction.

## Pop Operation

The `pop` operation removes the element from the top of the stack. It retrieves the most recently added element, and after the `pop` operation, the stack size decreases. Attempting to `pop` from an empty stack results in an underflow condition.

## Key Characteristics of a Stack

- **Top of the Stack:**
  - The top of the stack is the end from which `push` and `pop` operations occur. It is the position where the most recent element is added.

- **Base of the Stack:**
  - The base of the stack is the opposite end of the top, and it remains fixed. Elements that have been on the stack for a longer duration are closer to the base.

- **Stack Size:**
  - The size of the stack is dynamically adjusted as elements are `pushed` and `popped`. A stack can be of fixed or dynamic size, depending on the implementation.

- **Empty Stack:**
  - A stack is considered empty when it contains no elements. Attempting to `pop` from an empty stack results in an underflow condition.

- **Full Stack:**
  - In some implementations, a stack can be of a fixed size, and attempting to `push` onto a full stack results in an overflow condition.

## Common Operations on a Stack

1. **Push Operation:**
   - Adds an element to the top of the stack.

2. **Pop Operation:**
   - Removes the element from the top of the stack.

3. **Peek/Top Operation:**
   - Retrieves the element from the top of the stack without removing it.

4. **isEmpty Operation:**
   - Checks if the stack is empty.

## Applications of Stacks

- **Function Call Management:**
  - Stacks are used in programming languages to manage function calls and returns.

- **Expression Evaluation:**
  - Stacks are employed in evaluating expressions, particularly in converting infix expressions to postfix or prefix notation.

- **Undo Mechanism:**
  - Stacks are utilized in implementing undo mechanisms in various applications.

- **Backtracking Algorithms:**
  - Stacks are crucial in backtracking algorithms to keep track of choices and facilitate the process of undoing choices.
